# Solo Project #1: Building with Backgrounds and Gradients
Backgrounds are usually ignored until they become a problem and then you’re left trying to figure out why your elements are coming out looking so odd. This brief section should get you thinking properly about backgrounds and the kinds of things you can do with them by just using regular old CSS.

In this project you’ll clone the website of one of the most design-forward companies in the world. It’s not a very complex site but it uses background photos well and the navbar at the top contains a gradient that you should be able to mimic.
